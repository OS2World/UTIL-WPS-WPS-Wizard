# UTIL-WPS-WPS-Wizard
WPS-Wizard is a set of classes to add unique features to the WPS. It's seamlessly integrated and offers e.g. an info area for folders showing previews of images (eCS 1.2MR and above) and PDFs (if Lucide is installed), a technically advanced and unique Icon engine for using PNG image files as icons, a Rexx interface to the WPS and much more.
