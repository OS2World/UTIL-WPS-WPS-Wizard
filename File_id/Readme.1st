WPS-Wizard V0.6.0 adds an icon engine to the WPS so colorful PNG images
can be used as icons. A preview for image files and thumbnails created
by the Lucide application is added to the info area.
Some of the features are:

- Configurable menu items
- Different menu items for different classes
- Programmable object fly over help
- Folder toolbars (freely programmable). Change it using drag and drop.
- Folder information area. Changeable using Rexx.
- Gadgets for displaying information on the
  desktop as bars or text. These are small and easy to create
  REXX scripts.
- Contents of image files is displayed as the icon.
- A REXX interface is provided which gives access to the WPS
  from user scripts. Modify functions of WPS classes using
  REXX (similar to subclassing).
- A preview for image files and Lucide thumbnails is added
  to the info area of folders.
- Change icon size up to 200x200
- Icon engine for using PNG images as icons
- Icon engine allows image composition using simple statements
- Separate PNG icon package are available
- Help and tutorial included
- Workarounds for some WPS bugs


Installation
------------

Be sure to have installed Cairo 1.46, libc061
and the Innotek font engine. Otherwise installation will fail.

Font engine:

http://www.innotek.de/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=28&Itemid=44
(http://www.innotek.de/)

Cairo:

ftp://ftp.netlabs.org/pub/Cairo/


WPS-Wizard must be installed on a partition supporting
long filenames.

Before installation uninstall any prior release and restart
the WPS.

!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Be sure not to have any folder open while uninstalling.

!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Because the WPS sometimes keeps IDs around even if the object
belonging to the ID is already destroyed it's advised to remove
the old installation folder completely (make sure not to use the
trashcan) and run checkini afterwards.


!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Create a WPS archive before installation. Open the settings notebook
of the desktop and go to the 'Archive' page. Read the help for more
information. 

!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!


For installation move this directory to the desired location
and run install.cmd. 
The directory can't be moved afterwards because the DLLs
are locked by the WPS.


Crash recovery
--------------

If your WPS does not start anymore reboot and press Alt-F1 when the white eCS blob
is shown in the upper left corner. Reinstall the archive you created prior to
installation.

If you want to debug your problem press Alt-Ctrl when the WPS starts up. A recovery
dialog pops up you may use to disable features of WPS-Wizard.

The following options are available.

# Use eCS Icon drawing:

  Don't replace the functions used to draw icons. Note that this will disable hints, too.
  Cairo is still used to load PNG images. 

# No *.DLL loading tweak:

  Don't use a workaround to improve DLL loading by the WPS. Should be save to select.

# No class image loading

  Don't load PNG images for classes.

# No object image loading from INI

  Ignore references to PNG images in the theme ini for objects.

# No user image loading

  Don't load images assigned using the icon page in the settings.

# No Cairo icon drawing.

  Load PNG images but draw using eCS icon functions.

# Recover

  A recover feature renames the class DLL and prevents the WPS from loading any WPS-Wizard
  class. Refrences to the classes are still in your INI but this will not do any harm.

If you try to find a problem start without an installed theme first.


Problems
--------

- Registering classes may need up to a minute sometimes. So if the script seems to
  be stuck be patient.

- Sometimes after upgrading WPS-wizard toolbar items are broken. Just rerun the
  installation script and delete items which are duplicates. It's save to
  run the install script numerous times.

- When upgrading an installation it may happen that the private toolbar folders
  can't be found. A window pops up with an error message. If this happens delete
  the tree which held your previous installation, run checkini (to remove ID info from the
  INI) and reinstall WPS-wizard.

- Lucide previews are not shown if the IO procs from the eSchemes package are
  installed. The problem is the included GIF IO proc which seems not to be system conformant.

- There is no preview for bitmap files.

- Use 32bit with your graphics driver if drag and drop icons are "ghost" icons

- The icon editor is disabled for normal OS/2 icons if PNG icons are used

- WPS-Wizard does not work with the Turbo Folders feature of XWorkplace


Trap information is written to 'wpswiz.log' on your bootdrive.



Bug reports
-----------

There is a bugtracker at http://svn.netlabs.org/wps-wizard

Use guest/netlabs to login.

-Ask on irc for a possible solution (prefered)

-Before issuing a dozen tickets about install problems make sure your INI files are not
 broken.

-Try disabling other WPS addons before blaming WPS-Wizard for bugs. It's a matter
 of fact that WPS-Wizard often causes hidden bugs in other packages to appear (example:
 the GIF IO procedure problem with eSchemes). WPS-Wizard uses deeply hidden APIs of SOM
 (note: APIs not hacks) other addons are not aware of or use in a wrong way.
 
-Tickets without attached information about what's happening and how to reproduce problems
 will be ignored.

-I do this in my spare time not for money. If you piss at me don't expect a polite answer
 (or an answer at all...)


Icon themes
-----------

Icon themes can be found at

  ftp://ftp.netlabs.org/pub/wps-wizard/

Note that icon themes shouldn't be installed in a path containing spaces.


Older icon themes designed for V0.5.3 don't work with this release of WPS-Wizard.

The control file has to be renamed from

   CLASS-IMAGE.INI

   to

   wpswiz-theme.ini

For your convinience there is a script ../bin/theme/set-icon-theme.cmd to do all
the work. Copy it to the location where CLASS-IMAGE.INI is to be found and run
it. It will rename the INI file, set the particular theme as the new one and
restarts the WPS after confirmation.

!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Note: don't run the install script included with the old icon themes!
